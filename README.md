# JMinecraft
A clone of Minecraft Multiplayer (AAstr0Craft) - OpenGL/LWJGL

## Introduction
This project was not just OpenGL learning but also figuring out how you should structurize code in a way such that it fit's perfectly.
For me, I've done a perfect job on that, but also there's some deviations here and there.

Spending 2 months of my time on a thing that was painful to code, is a very hard thing to do,
especially when you're coding and learning OpenGL at the same time.

In those 2 months, I learned so much and fixed myself in different area's, that this project is from now on, a special project for me. 

## Details
  1. Supports multiplayer (tried up to 20 Clients => works perfectly fine)
  2. Supports infinite terrain
  3. Supports block placing/removing
  4. Supports "lightning" (even though it is technically not lightning)
  5. Supports basic minecraft logic.
## Requirements
  1. It needs to have a server up and running.
  2. If your PC is not capable of running AAstr0Craft, I suggest you to lower the chunk size (in IWorldConstants interface)
  3. Please, if you do play AAstr0Craft, do please notice that you have to change the InetAddress of Clients. (look AAstr0Craft class)

## Last thoughts
I want to thank myself for doing a project like this. I learned a lot :)
